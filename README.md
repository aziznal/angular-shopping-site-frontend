# Angular-based Shopping Site - Frontend

This is the Frontend for the [Backend Repository](https://www.github.com/aziznal/angular-shopping-site-backend)

This frontend was built using Angular as a framework. the HTML and CSS were written manually and with no particular structure in mind.
The CSS specifically does not employ the use of bootstrap or anything similiar.

---

Note: for this site to function properly, don't forget to also get the backend and run that, too.

Note 2: The backend for this site uses mongoDB to store its items and user info, but there is currently no data on this repo.
See [Backend Repository](https://www.github.com/aziznal/angular-shopping-site-backend) for more info.
